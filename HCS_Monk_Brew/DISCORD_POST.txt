**HCS Monk Brewmaster Script v1.0.0**

A complete Brewmaster tank rotation for Project Sylvanas with IZI SDK support.

**Features:**
✅ Shado-Pan & Master of Harmony builds
✅ M+ S3 tank buster reactions
✅ Self-healing (Expel Harm, potion, Fortifying, Celestial)
✅ Interrupts/stuns with boss checks (no wasted GCDs)
✅ Targeting modes: Manual / Casters first / Skull first
✅ Tiger's Lust root dispel
✅ Full cooldown management

**Installation:**
1. Extract the `HCS_Monk_Brew` folder to your `scripts/` directory
2. Ensure you have the shared modules (mplus_s3_interrupt_stun_list, mplus_s3_tank_buster_list, hcs_target_priority, etc.)
3. Reload scripts

**Files included:**
- `header.lua` - Plugin loader (class/spec validation)
- `main.lua` - Full rotation logic
- `README.md` - Detailed documentation

**Note:** Stuns and pushback effects automatically skip bosses to avoid wasting GCDs. Self-healing works even with no target.
