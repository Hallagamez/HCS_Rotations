# Project Sylvanas – Universal Racials (Reference)

Optional sub-plugin of **Universal Utility**. Install from Marketplace, then:

**Main Menu → Universal Utility → Universal Racials**

Automated usage of **Racial Abilities** (Orc, Troll, Undead, Blood Elf, etc.) based on combat context.

## Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Defensive** | Casts racials like **Stoneform**, **Shadowmeld**, or **Will of the Forsaken** in dangerous situations (incoming CC, magic damage). |
| **Offensive** | Uses abilities like **Blood Fury** or **Berserking** during burst windows or paired with other offensive cooldowns. |

## Smart usage logic

Racials are cast with context-aware logic, including:

- **Current health**
- **Buff uptime syncing**
- **Combat duration forecasts**

*Reference for HCS rotations: when using Universal Racials, rotation scripts can avoid duplicating racial logic.*
